# 539 Steganography and Cryptanalysis Project

The goal of this project is to gain experience with steganography, cryptanalysis, and random number generators. You will work at the byte level of files to create a bitmap image from scratch. You will programmatically modify such a file, hiding a message inside the image. In the second part, you will break an encryption by finding the key through a weakness in the random number generation.

## Technology Requirements

Programming assignments should be done using .NET Core 3.1. While you can write your code on a Windows or Mac machine, the autograder will test your code on Ubuntu 18.04. It is highly recommended to create a Virtual Machine for writing your assignments.

Information on how to install the .NET Core SDK on Ubuntu can be found on Microsoftâ€™s website: Install .NET Core SDK or .NET Core Runtime on Debian
